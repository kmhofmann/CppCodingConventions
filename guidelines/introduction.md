## Introduction

- This document provides a style guide for C++ code.
It provides both formatting conventions as well as guidelines for how to write good code, and what not to do.

  The document originates from a set of in-house C++ coding guidelines while the author was at [Blippar](http://www.blippar.com), but has and will continue to evolve beyond this use case.

- The guide assumes a certain level of familiarity with modern C++ features.
While the rationale for a certain rule is often given, the guide is not meant to be an introductory document.
Unlike other coding guidelines, the intention of the guidelines is *not* to limit usage of modern C++ features in any way.

- Sticking to a particular formatting convention ensures that code is written in a consistent fashion throughout the entire code base.
The formatting convention described in this document is optimized for readability and for writing clean code.
